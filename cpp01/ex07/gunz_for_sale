[Intro]
Woo wooo
Haha
G-Unit!

[Chorus]
We got those semi-automatics and we got them revolvers
We them niggas you should get at if you got a problem
When them hollow tips hit 'em, man, that should solve 'em
We got them Lugers, them Rugers, them M1s and they all for sale
Got that nine millimeter, got that ten millimeter
Got that little deuce deuce and they all for sale
Got that old trey pound, got that new four pound
They've been used once or twice and they all for sale

[Verse 1]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang
I'm the reason them thangs in my hood go "bang!"
I got that trey deuce, I call that, my nigga behave
16 gauge in case you niggas wanna get crazy
When a sawed off hit your body parts, they fall off
You get hit in the leg, man, you can't even crawl off
When that AK switch to automatic to spray
Everybody out this bitch could get hit with a stray
I got silences and scopes, military issued pistols
Holla at me, whatever you need, homie, I can get you
Nickname rubber grips, hollow tips, extra clips
You don't want your shit to jam, better buy a cleaning kit
Teflon, kevlar, need to wrap it round your chest
You pop off, they pop back and you get left a bloody mess
MAC-11, MAC-10, time for some action
Dump a clip out this bitch, see how niggas act then
Got guns and ammo, they all for sale
Clips included, you're responsible for your bail
[Chorus]
We got those semi-automatics and we got them revolvers
We them niggas you should get at if you got a problem
When them hollow tips hit 'em, man, that should solve 'em
We got them Lugers, them Rugers, them M1s and they all for sale
Got that nine millimeter, got that ten millimeter
Got that little deuce deuce and they all for sale
Got that old trey pound, got that new four pound
They've been used once or twice and they all for sale

[Verse 2]
G stand for "Gangster", Unit stand for "U Niggas In Trouble"
Better lock and load on the double, G-Unit!
Fresh out the box, 40 Cali Glocks
Calico 20 shot, street sweepers clear the block
I'm that nigga niggas call when them shots pop
Take 'em to my grandmama basement, show 'em what I got
Look, I got three 380s, a TEC and two M1s
Ice came through on some shit and bought him one
Them young boys from the projects crazy
He was kissing on the toast and saying "that's my baby"
Buck came through saying "50, show me some love"
Sold him a dub-dub, something he can sneak in the club
Gave him some shells for that trey 8 snub, he gave me some bud
I gave him a pound, gave me a hug, love is love
I take it back to the NWA days
Fuck Jake, my CDs raise the crime rate in the tri-state
Got some Rugers, some SIGs, some Colts
My nigga, for real, holla at the kid (they all for sale)
[Chorus]
We got those semi-automatics and we got them revolvers
We them niggas you should get at if you got a problem
When them hollow tips hit 'em, man, that should solve 'em
We got them Lugers, them Rugers, them M1s and they all for sale
Got that nine millimeter, got that ten millimeter
Got that little deuce deuce and they all for sale
Got that old trey pound, got that new four pound
They've been used once or twice and they all for sale

[Outro]
Yeah, man, y'all niggas got any problems?
Y'all know where y'all can reach me at, man
19174991919, homie
You know what I mean, holla at the kid
You know what I mean?
So what it got bodies on it, it still look new! Haha
